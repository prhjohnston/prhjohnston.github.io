    "text": "A mixture of essays and small, for-fun research projects on topics that interest me.\n\n\nThe existence of network effects is insufficient for causal explanation\n\n\nThe existence of network effects is insufficient for causal explanation\nOriginally published 9/10/2024\nIt has become fashionable lately in political science and economics to emphasize the role of social networks in explaining social phenomena. [examples!] The insight that “networks matter” is a basic and important one, and certainly coheres with our lived experiences of the world: We hear about new ideas, events, and behaviors from people in our networks—family, friends, coworkers, classmates. We may want to dress a certain way if our friends have started dressing that way, too. We may be more likely to vote for a candidate if we hear our colleagues discussing that candidate at work. But in this short essay, I want to make the simple point that networks themselves are not complete or satisfying causal explanations. As the adage goes, if one’s friends jumped off a cliff, one would (hopefully) have the wisdom to avoid following suit. My argument is that whenever it appears that a network explains some social, political, or economic outcome, there are several assumptions we should interrogate relating to the more fundamental causes of that outcome and the reasons the network is involved with the outcome’s spread or prevalence.\nFirst, we should avoid confusing the way in which the network is a proximal cause for an idea or behavior (in that it spreads, amplifies, or legitimates it) with the original (or distal) cause of that idea or behavior. The network itself logically cannot be the distal cause of the outcome. Absent some originating force like an exogenous shock or social/political/cultural entrepreneur(s), the idea or behavior would not exist to propagate through the network. The idea or behavior must come from somewhere. It is often important (yet overlooked) to ask.\nSecond, there are also questions one should ask about the propagation of information through the network itself. What social structures, conditions, or individual attributes encourage this propagation? When node A shares information with node B (thereby forming an edge in the network), this relies on the existence of not only some communication channel between them, but a willingness from A to use it. A significant amount of network analysis research in the social sciences has focused heavily on the receipt of information and less on the incentives or conditions under which an individual shares that information. Does sharing that information or behavior provide esteem for the sender, or does the sender hope to change the behavior of the receiver for either selfish or altruistic reasons?\nThird, if we observe individuals following behaviors only after their network demonstrated that behavior first, we should ask, why are these individuals susceptible to network influence? That is, what incentives or pressures do receivers have to adopt the behavior? There are many instances where individuals reject the candidate ideas or behaviors proffered by their networks. Agents endowed with reasoning skills, preferences, and experiences frequently assess whether the network’s behavior is rational from their perspective. Therefore, when an individual adopts an idea/behavior of their network, one or more of three things must be true: 1) the idea/behavior is utility-enhancing and preferable to alternatives (i.e., the individual has learned through the network); 2) the individual feels conscious or subconscious social pressure to adopt the idea/behavior, regardless of its merits; or 3) there are explicit coercive sanctions from the network to adopt the idea/behavior. In this context, we typically are less interested in behavior of category (3), which we don’t usually categorize as “network effects” but rather something like repression or private governance.\nFourth, and most fundamentally, why does the network exist at all, and why does it exist among these particular people? Many networks can be opted into (or opted out of). What about these individuals has brought them into the network, or kept them from leaving? We know from a rich literature in political economy and other subdisciplines on collective action that forming organizations is not straightforward. Networks are often (implicitly) contrasted with more formal organizations that involve costly behaviors such as homeowners’ associations, business groups, or social movements, but networks retain some similarities with these organizations. As mentioned above, sending information via networks does involve a cost to the sender (for example, time, breath, or effort, however small), and may also involve a cost to the receiver. It is usually not possible for an individual to opt out of all networks of which they are a member (true recluses are rare indeed), but it is usually possible to opt out of some networks, which individuals often do if the costs are too high. If a friend group has become hostile or exhausting, a person may quietly withdraw. If a family imposes strict traditional norms around religion or marriage, children may move away or disavow once they come of age. The point is this: networks of the sort typically referred to when we invoke “network analysis” in the social sciences require at least some degree of maintenance and consent, and these are themselves outcomes that must be explained. And crucially, the factors that cause an individual to join the network may also cause them to engage in the behavior reflected in the network. In other words, individual attributes are a confounder for both network membership and behavioral adoption. (A simple example is joining a club related to a hobby, and then adopting the behaviors or strategies from other members of the club—which one does precisely because they are interested in the hobby to begin with).\nWhat do we lose when we bypass the four complexities outlined above and skip straight to the part where networks are a proximal cause for a given outcome? My contention is that network effects are often less interesting than 1) the distal cause of the outcome; 2) the use of channels to spread the outcome; 3) the individual assent or propensity to adopt the behavior; and 4) the existence of the network itself. To take an example, consider a recent paper by the economists Cutler and Donahoe, who study why the opioid epidemic has persisted for so long, despite the seeming thermostatic effects that would cause individuals and policymakers to avoid addiction or overdose. They place the blame for the ongoing epidemic squarely at the feet of social network spillovers: when one individual consumes an opioid, they may tell their friends and families about it, and/or share pills either in person or through online platforms such as Facebook. Cutler and Donahoe state in the paper’s abstract that “spillovers explain 84 to 92 percent of opioid deaths from 1990 to 2018 and are the main reason deaths have increased for so long.” Ignoring for now the complexities introduced later in the paper, let’s take the sentence in the abstract at face value. Is it really the case that spillovers themselves are the reason why people die from opioids? No, of course not. Why do some people want to take opioids to begin with, or put another way, what social conditions make them liable to experiment with opioids and vulnerable to addiction? Although individuals may proximally hear about drugs or acquire them from local contacts, this is not a satisfying explanation for why the epidemic started or persists. Going through the four points outlined above as they pertain to this example, I would tentatively argue that all four significantly qualify the blunt statement that “spillovers cause opioid deaths” and in some cases provide a more interesting or fruitful avenue for social investigation than the mere fact of network spread itself. Consider each point in turn: 1) Origin: The creation of OxyContin and Purdue’s false advertising of it as non-addictive; 2) Propagation: The somewhat surprising fact that people are willing and interested in sharing drugs via channels like Facebook; 3) Uptake: The fact that millions of people have pain, either physical or socioemotional, that make them inclined to abuse opioids (i.e., adopt the behavior of the network); 4) Network existence: The fact that there are social networks in opioid-ravaged areas of the United States that share drugs or information about drugs with each other, or that existing social ties become hijacked and converted into narcotic networks\nEach of these points warrants explanation, as well as causal weighting (i.e., how relatively important is each in explaining the full picture of network-induced opioid addictions). In my view, spillovers themselves cannot provide a full causal explanation for a social outcome like the opioid epidemic. We need to understand the initial drivers, the incentives for propagation, the conditions for uptake, and the conditions for ongoing network existence and stability. When we incorporate these considerations, it becomes immediately clear that an explanation along the lines of Deaton and Case’s “deaths of despair” is needed (regardless of the truth of their particular argument). At least in the Deaton and Case account there is a plausible claim as to why people may want or need to take opioids, why social networks have been hijacked into being drug-sharing networks, and what policy prescriptions could exist that would address these background/distal causes rather than treating merely the proximal cause of network spillovers.\n\n\n\nDo international soccer teams with co-national managers perform better?\n\n\n\nDo international soccer teams with co-national managers perform better?\nOriginally published 9/10/2024\nThis past summer, I watched many hours of the Euros and Copa America international soccer tournaments. Most top teams generally have managers (aka coaches) from the same country as the players (Didier Deschamps with France, Gareth Southgate with England), but not all (examples!). This got me wondering—do teams who hire coaches from another country perform better or worse than teams who hire coaches from the same country?\nSoccer is a highly international sport, with players coming from virtually every continent. Liverpool FC, for example, my favorite club, regularly fields starting players from Egypt, Uruguay, Colombia, Argentina, the Netherlands, Scotland, France, and England. When players move teams, they’re often not just changing allegiances — they’re moving to a new country with a different language and culture. This poses a challenge from a team communication standpoint. Many foreign players take language classes, particularly in English, and some players may avoid media appearances for years, so as to not sound foolish giving an interview in their non-native tongue.\nContemporary soccer tactics are also fairly complex. Players need to know concepts such as “pressing triggers,” the difference between a regular and an “inverted” fullback, the difference between a single and “double pivot,” and so on. Managers attempt to stamp their tactical preferences on teams. When Arne Slot replaced Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, the consensus was that he preferred a slightly–but not excessively–possession-based playstyle that valued quick, short passes and prioritized control in the center of the pitch rather than the wings. Again, not entirely straightforward concepts to explain even to native speakers! The communication challenge of soccer tactics is greatly exacerbated by the strictures of international football, where teams have much less time to train together, and whose rosters are composed of whoever is best in the country at a given position, leading to imbalances where some positions have a dearth of talent, or where some players prefer one playstyle, and other players prefer another. Is it easier to figure out a cohesive playstyle and get a team playing together when the coach is from the same country as the players? What about when the coach is from another country, but still natively speaks the same language?\nsurprised that no one has examined this with data\ntested\ncontrol for ranks\n1 month before\n24 months before\nconclusion"

    "title": "Is the point of a system what it does?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In recent years I have noticed an increase in the number of people online and in some serious academic settings advancing some version of the claim that “the point of a system is what it does.” This is an idea from a field known as systems thinking, but applied to politics, it is usually intended to convey a point similar to the following: Dysfunctional institutions or policies which consistently produce subpar results as measured by some metric should be considered, for the tactical advancement of some practical purpose, as designed to produce those subpar results. Below is a tweet from a housing policy analyst discussing housing policy as such a dysfunction system in the US:\n\n\n\nI have seen this phrase deployed against many US institutions, most notably the criminal justice system, the US senate, or even, most grandiosely, capitalism itself.\nMy best understanding of why someone might want to advance this type of claim is that it builds support for an outright overhaul of a system by making it seem that the system is ill-designed in its essence. One component of this is intimating that a certain group of actors benefit from the dysfunction of the institution, and therefore its dysfunction is not really dysfunction at all, but an intended effect. If potential reform coalition allies believe that a system is not, in its purpose, designed to produce bad outcomes, then they may also hesitate before committing to system change and instead prefer incremental reforms. I somewhat doubt that this rhetorical approach is empirically effective at converting people to a reform cause (and of course there is the normative question of whether a given cause is a good one), but that is not the main point of this post. Instead, I want to take the claim seriously for a second and discuss why it does not make any analytical sense. This also affords an opportunity for a somewhat deeper discussion of the relationship between geneaology and teleology in institutions.\nI want to make five arguments. First, and most obviously, policies, systems, and institutions can and frequently do have unintended consequences. Institutional designers such as the drafters of the US Constitution may envision a certain function for an institution, only to discover that it has quite different effects in practice. Sometimes, this transmogrification can occur quite quickly, as happened with the Electoral College. Inasmuch as an institution’s original intended design confers onto it a telos (an idea I contest below), this telos can be betrayed by the unforeseen secondary effects of that institution! A justice system designed to fairly and expeditiously mete out justice that ends up having the unintended effects of delaying and distorting justice is not functioning according to its “point.” Just because some groups may benefit from these unforeseen consequences does not imply that these consequences were intended, or even that the benefitting group is involved in a volitional way at all. They may simply passively receive benefits from the unintended consequences.\nSecond, and more abstractly, it is not clear that a system or an institution is really something that has a “point” at all. A “point” here might mean an intended strategic or normative effect. A discrete policy may have a point, at least in the short window after it is passed. A simple bill to legalize marijuana recently passed by a state legislature has a point–to legalize marijuana. But does a system have a point? Systems are complex networks of interrelated actors, policies, institutions, and flows of resources and ideas between and within all of the nodes. The effects on various groups that emerge from that system can be heterogeneous and change over time. It seems like a category error to me to ascribe a single “point” to a system at all. Put differently, it’s not clear that an institution has a telos, and even if so, this telos likely does not come entirely from the original design of the institution. Believing that the genealogy of an institution is equivalent to its teleology seems like a weird thing for people on the left to believe, given its similarity to textualism/originalism, which we know is largely bunk and a smokescreen for ideological preferences.\nThird, institutions can have different effects depending on the actor interacting with that institution. Some political groups may depend crucially on an institution for resources, whereas other groups would be better off abolishing it altogether. Therefore, a system does not typically have a single, identifiable answer to “what it does.” This is increasingly true as the system gets more complex, older, and more important. What does the US Senate do? Well, it passes laws, empowers individual politicians and their networks, overrepresents constituents from small states, blocks legislative reform with its filibuster rules, etc. At different times and to different people, one or more of these effects can be relevant or irrelevant, salutary or harmful. Whenever we boil down a system to a single effect to highlight “what it does,” this is a strategic and intentional misrepresentation. Whether or not that misrepresentation is worthwhile depends on whether such a rhetorical move results in a good outcome. But it is not usually a faithful and clearsighted analysis of politics. If the idea is to emphasize a particular problem with a system or institution, and to argue that this problem outweighs any of the other effects of that institution, then I don’t see why someone couldn’t just say that.\nFourth, and relatedly, scholars of institutions note that actors within institutions are constantly in struggle over institutional rules. Institutions are never static. Politics occurs both within them as members vie for power with each other, and without them as those outside the institution either seek to enter it, reform it, or abolish it. As the balance of power between these groups changes, the institution’s effects can change, even if the formal rules do not. (See the work of Streeck and Thelen, as well as Jacob Hacker.) And, sometimes, the formal rules do in fact change! The “point of a system” varies over time. Even for an individual discrete policy, the “point” may exist in the short window after policy passage, but once it becomes law, it can immediately create new politics. Political scientists refer to this as “policy feedback” since a policy passed at time \\(t\\) affect politics at time \\(t+1\\). Perhaps a policy empowers a new group of actors by transferring resources to them or by encouraging their political mobilization. This group then uses their newfound influence to pass other policies. In a way, the original policy has had the “point”—intended or not—of furthering the later policies passed by the newly empowered group. Incidentally, this is exactly what happened with Social Security in the US, which empowered and mobilized seniors, profoundly shaping politics in other domains, not just retirement and pensions. Policies in one domain can also be used, both politically and in court, to obliquely justify other actions or decisions. Any lawyer knows that precedents can evolve in interesting ways, in part because, as this understanding of institutions would predict, attorneys are incentivized to search far and wide for any type of case law that might be relevant for their client’s case. Even if a decision were arrived at in a totally different context, it can still end up being used down the line for creating new rules and shaping the distribution of power. In this way, the “point” of even something relatively self-contained as an individual policy or court case can contingently evolve and mutate as politics progresses.\nFinally, I think this way of thinking ignores negative equilibria as a feature of social and political life. Sometimes, we are all worse off despite us following our individual incentives. Just because the system is broken, doesn’t mean someone prefers it that way. We can all prefer to live in a better world, but lack the means of getting there."

    "text": "I am a PhD candidate in the MIT Department of Political Science. My research uses survey, spatial, and firm-level data to study how societies adapt to climate change. My dissertation project examines the politics of property and disaster insurance in the US and other advanced democracies in an era of rising climate risk. Other research interests include the American Political Economy, especially money in politics, and comparative political behavior.\nI am a graduate student affiliate of the Minda de Gunzberg Center for European Studies at Harvard. Together with Clemente T. Sanchez, I run the Comparative Politics and Political Economy (COPE) graduate student seminar at MIT.\nBefore graduate school, I received an undergraduate degree in Politics with a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning from Princeton University. You can find my CV here.\n\n\nResearch in progress\n\n\nVoters Uncovered: Home insurance availability, electoral accountability, and climate adaptation\n\nThis paper studies the electoral implications of the unfolding climate-change-driven home insurance crisis in the United States. In recent years, home insurance prices have risen significantly faster than inflation and the non-renewal rate, a measure of coverage unavailability, has more than doubled. Drawing on county-level panel data on election returns and home insurance non-renewal rates, I use a difference-in-differences framework to examine whether declines in home insurance availability caused anti-incumbent voting in gubernatorial and insurance commissioner elections in the period 2017-2024. I find that declining coverage availability results in an electoral penalty for Democratic governors, with more ambiguous effects on insurance commissioner elections. Given the potential political costs to coverage declines, I then turn to an analysis of whether voters reward incumbents for policies designed to reduce non-renewals. In particular, I study a recent California policy that places a one-year moratorium on coverage non-renewals in the wake of wildfires. I find that coverage non-renewal moratoria that expire prior to the 2022 election reduce incumbent voteshare. This finding is explained by the fact that insurers immediately increase premiums following moratorium issuance and accelerate coverage withdrawals following moratorium expiry. The results highlight the dilemmas facing governments dependent on the private insurance industry to protect homeowners against rising climate risk. As climate change worsens, electoral politics may create incentives to mitigate the passthrough of climate risk to households.\n\n\n\nEthnicity and Climate Dissensus in Africa (with Devin Caughey and Evan Lieberman)\n\nThe African continent has already experienced severe climate impacts, yet public attitudes toward climate change vary widely within and across countries. Drawing on Afrobarometer surveys from 29 countries, we test whether opinions are divided along ethnic lines. We find evidence of ethnic dissensus in nearly every country, strongest in perceptions of climate hazards but also present in views on policy responses. Using Bayesian multilevel models, we assess three explanations: individual composition of groups, group-level attributes, and geographic context. We find the strongest evidence for the third explanation, specifically that dissensus is greatest where ethnic groups are more regionally segregated. Additionally, wealthier groups tend to be more aware of climate issues yet less concerned about action, though inequality itself does not predict dissensus. These findings underscore the links between ethnicity, regionalism, and climate politics, contributing to research on ethnic politics, public goods provision, and the emerging field of climate-related attitudes. (Draft available upon request)\n\n\n\nCan You Stand the Heat? Ideology and Individual-level Climate Adaptation in Brazil (with Clemente T. Sanchez)\n\nHow do people adapt to climate change? Although individuals have incentives to change their lifestyles and economic choices to reduce their exposure to climate risks, decades of research have also shown that risk perceptions and tolerance are shaped by social and political factors. We propose that just as politics may affect whether individuals develop concern for climate change, it may also affect the adaptive actions individuals take in response to climate trends. Studying the case of Brazil, a country which faces severe climate risks, we focus on one channel through which party politics may affect individual climate adaptation: differential risk tolerance. Leveraging a large representative survey of Brazilian households in conjunction with a novel survey experiment, we examine whether respondents living in conservative areas show lower elasticities of self-reported adaptation to climate risks such as drought, floods, temperature anomalies, and fires. If so, this may indicate that political ideology can moderate the relationship between risk and adaptation, possibly contributing to adaptation shortfalls in the developing world.\n\n\n\nPulling the Fire Alarm? Insurer corporate political behavior on climate change\n\nHow do firms cross-pressured between energy transition risk and physical climate risk engage with climate politics? I hypothesize that cross-pressured firms will support climate adaptation policy as a way of simultaneously reducing physical risk exposure without jeopardizing their carbon-intensive assets. Focusing on a most-likely case for the hypothesis, I examine one of the largest industries financially affected by rising climate risk: US property insurers. Large underwriting losses from climate shocks threaten industry profits and invite state intervention, seemingly creating large incentives to support decarbonization. Simultaneously, insurers are institutional investors in the carbon-intensive status quo, which confers transition risk. Linking a panel of insurer characteristics and security-level investment data with information on their lobbying and campaign contributions, I study how investments in fossil fuels (a measure of transition risk) and loss ratios on catastrophe-relevant underwriting (physical risk) affect insurer political behavior. Descriptively, insurers began lobbying on climate-related topics and realigned to support Democratic candidates after the 2017 climate-driven hardening to reinsurance markets. As predicted, most of the recent expansion of climate-relevant lobbying is on adaptation topics, rather than mitigation. Cross-sectionally, insurers’ exposure to catastrophe-relevant underwriting and fossil investments are associated with more and less climate-friendly political behavior, respectively. The findings aim to contribute to growing literatures on insurance politics under climate change, firms’ responses to climate risk, and the politics of adaptation."

I define a private sector position (PSP) as a politician holding an executive, ownership, or director position at a firm while running for office. I acquire data on House members’ outside positions and create a new dataset of challenger candidates’ outside positions by digitizing their financial disclosure documents. I argue that PSPs may provide electoral resources to politicians, including in the form of campaign finance and politically influenced business decisions. I then estimate whether PSPs are associated with higher election returns and examine how the effect differs across party and incumbency status. I find that PSPs are associated with a significant electoral advantage, with the effect highest for challenger candidates and Republicans. I investigate two potential mechanisms to explain this result: campaign finance and expansionary behavior around election cycles. I find that candidates with PSPs receive more total contributions, contributions from committees, and individual donations. Linking firms declared on candidates’ financial disclosures to panel data on firm characteristics, I find some evidence that firms connected to incumbents hire more during election years relative to challenger-connected and unconnected firms. This suggests that incumbent-connected firms engage in behavior analogous to political business cycles. These results contribute to a growing literature showing politicians with corporate connections can advance their political careers by extracting costly favors from firms.

My contention is that network effects are often less interesting than 1) the distal cause of the outcome; 2) the use of channels to spread the outcome; 3) the individual assent or propensity to adopt the behavior; and 4) the existence of the network itself. To take an example, consider a recent paper by the economists Cutler and Donahoe, who study why the opioid epidemic has persisted for so long, despite the seeming thermostatic effects that would cause individuals and policymakers to avoid addiction or overdose. They place the blame for the ongoing epidemic squarely at the feet of social network spillovers: when one individual consumes an opioid, they may tell their friends and families about it, and/or share pills either in person or through online platforms such as Facebook. Cutler and Donahoe state in the paper’s abstract that “spillovers explain 84 to 92 percent of opioid deaths from 1990 to 2018 and are the main reason deaths have increased for so long.” Ignoring for now the complexities introduced later in the paper, let’s take the sentence in the abstract at face value. Is it really the case that spillovers themselves are the reason why people die from opioids? No, of course not. Why do some people want to take opioids to begin with, or put another way, what social conditions make them liable to experiment with opioids and vulnerable to addiction? Although individuals may proximally hear about drugs or acquire them from local contacts, this is not a satisfying explanation for why the epidemic started or persists. Going through the four points outlined above as they pertain to this example, I would tentatively argue that all four significantly qualify the blunt statement that “spillovers cause opioid deaths” and in some cases provide a more interesting or fruitful avenue for social investigation than the mere fact of network spread itself. Consider each point in turn: 1) Origin: The creation of OxyContin and Purdue’s false advertising of it as non-addictive; 2) Propagation: The somewhat surprising fact that people are willing and interested in sharing drugs via channels like Facebook; 3) Uptake: The fact that millions of people have pain, either physical or socioemotional, that make them inclined to abuse opioids (i.e., adopt the behavior of the network); 4) Network existence: The fact that there are social networks in opioid-ravaged areas of the United States that share drugs or information about drugs with each other, or that existing social ties become hijacked and converted into narcotic networks\nEach of these points warrants explanation, as well as causal weighting (i.e., how relatively important is each in explaining the full picture of network-induced opioid addictions). In my view, spillovers themselves cannot provide a full causal explanation for a social outcome like the opioid epidemic. We need to understand the initial drivers, the incentives for propagation, the conditions for uptake, and the conditions for ongoing network existence and stability. When we incorporate these considerations, it becomes immediately clear that an explanation along the lines of Deaton and Case’s “deaths of despair” is needed (regardless of the truth of their particular argument). At least in the Deaton and Case account there is a plausible claim as to why people may want or need to take opioids, why social networks have been hijacked into being drug-sharing networks, and what policy prescriptions could exist that would address these background/distal causes rather than treating merely the proximal cause of network spillovers."

    "title": "Do international soccer teams with co-national managers perform better?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This past summer, I watched many hours of the Euros and Copa America international soccer tournaments. Most top teams generally have managers (aka coaches) from the same country as the players (Didier Deschamps with France, Gareth Southgate with England), but not all (examples!). This got me wondering—do teams who hire coaches from another country perform better or worse than teams who hire coaches from the same country?\nSoccer is a highly international sport, with players coming from virtually every continent. Liverpool FC, for example, my favorite club, regularly fields starting players from Egypt, Uruguay, Colombia, Argentina, the Netherlands, Scotland, France, and England. When players move teams, they’re often not just changing allegiances — they’re moving to a new country with a different language and culture. This poses a challenge from a team communication standpoint. Many foreign players take language classes, particularly in English, and some players may avoid media appearances for years, so as to not sound foolish giving an interview in their non-native tongue.\nContemporary soccer tactics are also fairly complex. Players need to know concepts such as “pressing triggers,” the difference between a regular and an “inverted” fullback, the difference between a single and “double pivot,” and so on. Managers attempt to stamp their tactical preferences on teams. When Arne Slot replaced Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, the consensus was that he preferred a slightly–but not excessively–possession-based playstyle that valued quick, short passes and prioritized control in the center of the pitch rather than the wings. Again, not entirely straightforward concepts to explain even to native speakers! The communication challenge of soccer tactics is greatly exacerbated by the strictures of international football, where teams have much less time to train together, and whose rosters are composed of whoever is best in the country at a given position, leading to imbalances where some positions have a dearth of talent, or where some players prefer one playstyle, and other players prefer another. Is it easier to figure out a cohesive playstyle and get a team playing together when the coach is from the same country as the players? What about when the coach is from another country, but still natively speaks the same language?\nsurprised that no one has examined this with data\ntested\ncontrol for ranks\n1 month before\n24 months before\nconclusion"
