I am a PhD candidate in the MIT Department of Political Science. My research uses survey, spatial, and firm-level data to study how individuals, companies, and governments adapt to climate change. My dissertation project examines the politics of property and disaster insurance in the US and other advanced democracies in an era of rising climate risk.

Other research interests include the American Political Economy, especially money in politics, and comparative political behavior. 

Together with [Clemente T. Sanchez](https://www.clementesanchez.com/), I run the [Comparative Politics and Political Economy](https://cis.mit.edu/current-working-groups) (COPE) graduate student seminar at MIT.  

I am a graduate student [affiliate](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/preston-r-johnston) of the Minda de Gunzberg Center for European Studies at Harvard. Before graduate school, I received an undergraduate degree in Politics with a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning from Princeton University.

In the [research](research.qmd) tab, you can learn more about my work.

<!--In the [writing](blog.qmd) tab, I post blog-style content on a variety of topics, including essays and small, for-fun research projects.
 
 <!--Outside of work, I also compose music, some of which you can find in the [music](music.qmd) tab. -->
