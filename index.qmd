I am a PhD candidate in the MIT Department of Political Science. My work uses survey, spatial, and firm-level data to study how individuals, companies, and governments adapt to climate change. My dissertation project examines the politics of property and disaster insurance in the US and other advanced democracies in an era of rising climate risk.

Other research interests include market concentration and money in politics in the US, and how political and social identities shape risk tolerance and policy preferences.

In addition to my dissertation, I am working on projects studying how ethnicity structures dissensus on climate change opinion across African countries, the electoral implications of US House candidates' outside private sector positions, and the political drivers of climate adaptation behavior in Brazil.

I am also a graduate student affiliate of the Minda de Gunzberg Center for European Studies at Harvard. Before graduate school, I received an undergraduate degree in Politics with a certificate in Statistics and Machine Learning from Princeton University.

In the [research](research.qmd) tab, you can learn more about my work.

<!--In the [writing](blog.qmd) tab, I post blog-style content on a variety of topics, including essays and small, for-fun research projects.
 
 <!--Outside of work, I also compose music, some of which you can find in the [music](music.qmd) tab. -->
